# SmartMeal

Smart Meal PLanner is a meal planning application that helps users plan out their weekly meal schedule and grocery shopping. The app is built with a React front end and Express Node.js back end. The application is made up of 5 core features:

  - Weekly Plan: A weekly calendar to keep track of meals you plan to eat on a given week
  - Search: A search function that allows users to look for recipes via the Spoonacular API
  - Pantry List: List to keep track of ingredients you have on hand. Ingredients correspond to those available on Spoonacular. 
  - Grocery List: Auto generated list based on your weekly meal plan and your pantry items. 
  - Favourites: A page to view your favourited recipes
 

### Database Setup

Fort it over uses a PostgreSQL database. Users are free to set up the database how they choose as long as they make the appropriate adjustments to their .env file (See .env.example). We used the following comands:

1. `$ psql`
2. `CREATE DATABASE final OWNER labber`
3. `\c final -U labber`
4. `\i db/schema/main_schema.sql`
5. `\i db/seeds/main_seed.sql`
6. In a new tab `$ cd server`
7. Install dependencies with `$ npm install`
8. `$ npm start`

### Running the React App

1. In a new tab `cd client` 
2. Install dependencies with `yarn install`
3. Update the proxy in the package.json file to match the port number of your local database
4. `$ yarn start`

** Note: to access any of the recipe information you will need to register for a Spoonacular API key and add it to the .env file **
